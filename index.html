                            <p class="intro">In this assignment, we were to
                                choose a subject
                                outside of our main discipline. For me, that
                                meant I had to choose something outside of
                                Computer Science, New Media, and Physics. So,
                                why did I
                                choose Economics? I had taken ECON1010, a
                                microeconomics class last year and the concept
                                of scarcity really stood out to me. Since the
                                beginning of time, the struggle against scarcity
                                has been a constant. It is a concept that
                                affects so many aspects of life from an
                                individual to global level. I want to relate
                                this concept with mental health and so I will be
                                focusing on the individual level for this
                                project.</p>

                                    scarce means. The examples we have discussed
                                    already
                                    harmonise perfectly with this conception.

                                    involves the withdrawal of scarce goods and

                                    in conditions of scarcity, whether coming
