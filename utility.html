                <p>Everyday we deal with the struggle of scarcity. There
                    is only so much we can achieve in a lifetime and so
                    every choice we make is important, no matter how
                    small.<br>
                    </br>
                    Greek philosopher Hesiod is regarded as the first economist to acknowledge this as a problem. At
                    the core, scarcity is what economics is all about. Wars are fought over scarce resources,
                    poverty, hunger and famine still exists, I want to say that the human condition itself is a
                    manifestation of
                    scarcity. <br>
                    </br>Establish priorities. Choices will be presented to you. And it is up to you, to decide
                    what you believe is beneficial to you. It's different for every individual and there are
                    obviously so many external factors that will affect real life decisions. Regardless, for the
                    sake of simplicity I present to you, a short narrative of how external factors can affect this
                    process.</p>
